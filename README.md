# ApartmentMangementSystem
This is my newest my project.My project has a React JS front end, an ASP.Net API backend, and it connects to a SQL database. You can upload/edit/delete tenants, properties, receipts
and pictures. It is integrated with Auth0 for authenication. It autosuggests addresses when filling out the property form using the HERE api. It also has automated task schduling using 
Hangfire. Once a day it checks if there are any leases that are about to expire and it will send a text message via Twillo. It will have a dashboard for analytics. It has aspects of Bootstrap
and Material UI.
